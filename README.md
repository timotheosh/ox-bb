This tries to be an [Org](https://orgmode.org) export backend to generate
[BBCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode) suitable for some web
forums and other applications.  Code blocks will be exported for the
[GeSHI](https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0) plugin but don't expect this to
work on every forum.
